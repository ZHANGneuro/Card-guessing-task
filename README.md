Card-guessing-task
==================

for capturing the signal of Gambler's fallacy


This script implements a card guessing task described in: 
Xue, G., et al. (2012). "Lateral prefrontal cortex contributes to maladaptive decisions." 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109(12): 4401-4406.

In this task,  subjects are to predict computer's choice of a black or red card.

Computer's choices were a predetermined canonical random sequence generated by a 
Bernoulli process characterized by 
(i) equal numbers of black and red cards, 
(ii) switch of card choice on half the trials,  
(iii) streak length in an exponential distribution.

This task contains two runs, in each run, the computer has 63 predetermined choices, in the first run the computer's choice 
consists of 31 black cards and 32 red cards, in the second run it includes 32 black cards and 31 red cards.

Note in Xue's Paper, just 1 carefully picked and predetermined computers' choice sequence was generated and was used for all subjects.

In this task, Inter-stimuli interval was set to 1s (9s in Xue's paper).

Subject press "Q" for choosing the left card, and press "P" for choosing the right one.
